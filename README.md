# TTN Master Gateway Configurations

This Repository has adapted global_conf files for:

- Multitech Conduit
- Multitech Conduit AP

I've created this as it seems that both devices require different radio tuning configs to work optimally, and there doesn't seem to be an optimal TTN configuration for the Conduit AP yet.

_Note: Only EU config files are provided here. I personally have no need for other regions are this time, but maybe in the future!_

Enjoy!
